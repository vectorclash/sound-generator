# Infinite Music Generator

A self-contained, browser-based generative music system. Built entirely with the Web Audio API and Three.js — no server, no runtime dependencies beyond a CDN script tag.

Run `npm install && npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:8000/` (ES modules need to be served over HTTP, not opened via `file://`).

## Modes

### Infinite Mode

Click **PLAY** to start. The button toggles to **STOP**, allowing playback to be halted without switching modes. The system runs indefinitely, slowly evolving through eras of music. The composition auto-generates, shifts key and scale every 38 seconds, and continuously drifts in texture and density. A live status bar shows root note, scale, tempo, era number, and era progress.

### Manual Mode

Full control over every parameter. The panel is divided into three collapsible sections — **GENRE**, **FEEL**, and **INSTRUMENTS** — to reduce visual clutter.

**Genre presets** (AMBIENT, DARK, JAZZ, ELEC, ORCH, ZEN, BLUES, FOLK, DREAM, FUNK, EPIC) instantly configure a musically coherent combination of scale, tempo, density, brightness, spaciousness, and the two harmony controls — e.g. JAZZ and BLUES loosen the chord-tone lock and move chords every 4 beats, while AMBIENT, ZEN, and DREAM keep tight, consonant voices over long 8-beat chords. **RANDOM** picks a fresh random combination of all parameters and instruments. Entering Manual mode with no instruments selected automatically randomises.

**SHARE** encodes the full current configuration — key, scale, tempo, all five feel sliders, and every enabled instrument — as a 14-byte binary payload in the URL hash (`#c=…`, 19 base64url characters). Clicking the button copies the URL to the clipboard. Loading that URL restores the exact configuration. Fields have only ever been appended, so older 11- and 13-byte links still load (missing fields fall back to their defaults). The instrument bitmask order is spelled out in `ALL_INST_KEYS` and must only ever be appended to.

**Controls:**
| Control | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| BPM | 50–140 | Tempo (changes take effect on the beat grid without drift) |
| Octave | −3…+1 | Shifts every voice's register. Each instrument folds into the range it can actually sound in, so −3 deepens the mix without pushing the bass below hearing |
| Density | 0–1 | Note volume and presence |
| Brightness | 0–1 | Filter cutoffs (pad, drone, strings, brass, arpeggio, clavinet) and cymbal level |
| Spaciousness | 0–1 | Reverb send on the sustained voices |
| Harmony | 0–1 | How strongly melodic voices lock to chord tones — 0 lets them roam the whole scale (looser, more random), 1 keeps them strictly on the chord (tighter, more consonant). Triads and bass always follow the progression. |
| Chord | 2–8 beats | How often the chord progression advances — low = fast harmonic motion, high = long, slow-changing chords |

**Export** records a WAV file of exactly the requested duration. A 3-2-1 countdown mutes any previously playing audio so the recording starts clean. Over the last moments of the recording window (up to 0.4 s) a fade on the audio clock lets decaying voices die away instead of being chopped, and no new notes start inside it. The raw MediaRecorder capture is decoded and trimmed to exactly `duration × sampleRate` samples before writing the WAV header, so a 10-second export is precisely 10 seconds.

## Audio Engine

All sound is synthesised in real time — no samples. Notes are Web Audio nodes created, scheduled and discarded; plucked strings are rendered per note by a physical model into a buffer. A scheduler fires every 60 ms and fills a 120 ms lookahead window (`LOOKAHEAD = 0.12`), the standard technique for glitch-free timing from JavaScript.

### Timing: one beat grid (`src/audio/transport.js`)

Every voice schedules in **beats**, not seconds. The transport converts beats to audio time and, when the tempo changes, re-anchors at the current position so the grid stays continuous. Consequences:

- Bar lines, chord changes, drum steps and melodic phrases all line up.
- A voice that joins mid-playback (toggled on, or picked by a new era) enters on the next grid line instead of replaying every note it "missed" in one burst.
- Each playback run is a **session** with its own dry/reverb/echo buses. Stopping and restarting disconnects the old session, so nothing queued before the stop (a 16-beat drone, an echo tail) leaks into the new music.

### Harmony engine (`src/audio/harmony.js`)

All pitched voices read the current chord from one place, so the pad, bass, melody and choir always agree.

**Chords** are built by stacking diatonic thirds on a scale degree, which yields the right quality for the active mode automatically.

**Progressions are per mode.** Each mode has its own library that features its characteristic chord — Dorian IV (`i–IV`), Phrygian ♭II (`i–♭II`, the Andalusian descent), Lydian II (`I–II`), Mixolydian ♭VII (`I–♭VII–IV`), Aeolian `i–VI–III–VII` and friends — and avoids the mode's diminished triad (a single shared list gave Lydian `I–♯iv°–V–I`). Pentatonic scales stack into open quartal voicings and use gentle motion.

**Form.** A progression (A) is played twice, a contrasting one (B) once, then A returns: AABA, 16 chords.

**Harmonic rhythm.** A chord lasts `chordBeats` beats on the transport grid. Voices ask for the chord *at the beat they are scheduling*, so a note on a chord change gets the new chord, and sustained voices end exactly at the change instead of holding the old chord over the new one.

**Colour.** Chords sometimes carry their 7th — more often when the **Harmony** control is looser (jazz, blues) — and every chordal voice uses the same decision, so melodies treat the 7th as a chord tone only when it is actually voiced.

**Voice leading.** Chordal voices choose the inversion and octave of each chord that moves least from the previous voicing, with a pull back toward the instrument's register. Measured over 50 random progressions: 3.4 semitones of total movement per chord change, against 8.8 for root-position blocks.

### Melody: motifs and phrases (`src/audio/phrase.js`)

Melodic voices are built from **motifs** — a one-bar rhythm cell plus a contour — developed over a 4-bar phrase:

| Bar | Role | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Statement | The motif |
| 2 | Sequence | Same motif, restarted on the new chord |
| 3 | Variation | Same rhythm, contour inverted |
| 4 | Cadence | A closing rhythm landing on a stable tone (root, then fifth/third) |

The motif carries into the next phrase more often than not (repetition is what makes a line memorable). Note choice follows voice-leading practice: chord tones on strong beats (~90%), passing tones allowed on weak ones (~35% chord tones), and a leap of a fourth or more is followed by a step back the other way. Velocity follows the metre (downbeat accents) and the phrase (a swell into bar 3).

**Call and response.** With two or more lead instruments active, they trade two-bar phrases and share the motif, so the answer imitates the call; whoever isn't soloing drops to occasional soft chord tones.

**Ostinato mode** (kalimba, marimba, clavinet) repeats one cell every bar and re-anchors it to each chord — a riff that follows the changes.

### Bass (always available)

Every style lands the chord root on each chord arrival and never holds a note across a change. Root motion takes the nearest octave with a pull toward home, and the register is kept between E1 and G3 whatever the octave setting.

| Style | Line | Sound |
|---|---|---|
| SUB | One root per chord | Sine + triangle, sub-octave only where it is still audible (≥ 35 Hz) |
| PLUCK | One-bar rhythms of root/fifth/octave; the last note before a change is an approach tone | Finger bass — Karplus–Strong string |
| WALK | Quarter notes: root on arrival, chord tones on strong beats, scale steps heading toward the next root, and a chromatic, diatonic or dominant approach on the last beat | Upright bass — Karplus–Strong string, dark and plucked mid-string, plus a finger thump |
| SYNTH | 16th-note patterns: octave bounce, off-beat, 3-3-2 syncopation, driving eighths | Detuned saws through a resonant filter sweep |
| RUMBLE | One root per chord | Square + sine sub with slow tremolo |

### Instruments

Twenty instruments in four roles. Infinite mode builds each era's arrangement from roles — one or two **bed** voices, usually one **lead**, one or two **motion** voices, sometimes **air**, drums about a third of the time — instead of drawing at random (which could produce four melodies and no harmony).

#### Bed — chordal, change on the harmonic rhythm, voice-led

| Instrument | Synthesis |
|---|---|
| **Pad** | Detuned saw pair per note into one lowpass that breathes on a slow LFO; attack scales with chord length; releases overlap the next chord |
| **Strings** | Three detuned saws per note (ensemble), a lowpass that opens as bow pressure builds, and per-note vibrato at slightly different rates, faded in after the attack |
| **Choir** | Formant synthesis: the chord's detuned saws (plus a breath of aspiration noise) feed one bank of three band-pass filters tuned to the formants F1–F3 of a vowel (alto tables), which glides from one vowel to another ("ooh" → "aah") over the chord. Vibrato from two slightly different LFOs |
| **Organ** | Tonewheel drawbars at true organ footages (16′ 5⅓′ 8′ 4′ … = 0.5, 1.5, 1, 2 … × pitch), 3 dB per drawbar step, one of five classic registrations per session; one Leslie rotor for the whole chord (amplitude + Doppler pitch wobble, chorale or tremolo speed); percussion (decaying 2⅔′) and key click |
| **Drone** | Tonic + perfect fifth pedal, detuned pairs, very slow filter sweep; successive drones cross-fade, and a key change releases the old one |

#### Lead — phrase generator, call and response

| Instrument | Synthesis |
|---|---|
| **Melody** | Soft synth lead: triangle + quiet octave, delayed vibrato |
| **Flute** | Near-sine with weak 2nd/3rd harmonics (thinning in the high register), breath noise through the whole note plus an attack "chiff", pitch settling from slightly flat, delayed pitch + amplitude vibrato |
| **Brass** | Brightness follows loudness (lowpass "bloom"), pitch scoops up as the lips lock on, delayed vibrato; strong notes are sometimes harmonised a third below |
| **Sitar** | Bright Karplus–Strong string plucked near the bridge, through an asymmetric waveshaper and presence band (the buzzing *jawari* bridge); *meend* glides from the previous note when it is close; sympathetic strings ring when the played pitch class matches |
| **Vibraphone** | Tuned bar partials at 1 : 4 : ~10, motor tremolo (speed chosen per session, sometimes off), soft mallet contact, pedal-length ring |

#### Motion — rhythmic figures

| Instrument | Synthesis / playing |
|---|---|
| **Arpeggio** | Arpeggiator locked to the global grid (up, down, up-down, Alberti, broken thirds, pinky pedal), re-mapped onto each chord; saw through a snappy resonant lowpass into the tempo-synced echo |
| **Harp** | Karplus–Strong strings with a soft finger-like excitation plucked mid-string; a rolled chord marks each chord change, with occasional single chord tones between |
| **Pluck** | Fingerpicked steel-string guitar (Travis picking): thumb alternates root and fifth on the beat, fingers pick upper chord tones on the off-beats, occasional pinch on beat one |
| **Kalimba** | Near-sine tine with a brief ~6× inharmonic overtone and a woody box thump; ostinato figures, sometimes a second thumb a third below |
| **Mallet** | Marimba bars at 1 : 4 : ~9.4 with pitch-dependent decay and a yarn-mallet thump; ostinato figures |
| **Clavinet** | Very bright Karplus–Strong string struck near the bridge, damped on key-up, through a lowpass that snaps shut (the funk "quack"); repeating riffs with occasional double-stops |
| **Rhodes** | Two-operator FM tine piano (1:1 modulator whose depth follows velocity for the "bark", 14:1 for the tine ping) comping rootless voicings (3-5-7-9, ♭9 avoided) in syncopated rhythms, anticipating chord changes by an eighth, through a stereo auto-pan |

#### Air — sparse chord tones

| Instrument | Synthesis |
|---|---|
| **Bell** | Handbell: strong harmonic partials (1, 2, 3) and faint, fast-decaying inharmonic ones, a second fundamental a fraction of a hertz off for the slow warble, a strike click |
| **Glass** | Glass harmonica: near-pure tone with a slow swell and a partial 1–2 Hz away for audible beating |
| **Texture** | Two slightly detuned sines + octave, mostly reverb and echo |

### Drums

A step sequencer: one bar per pattern, written as strings (`X` accent, `x` hit, `o` medium, `g` ghost, `f` feathered, `?` sometimes-ghost, `.` rest). Patterns run on 16 steps (sixteenths) or 12 (eighth-note triplets — true shuffle and 12/8 feel), with optional MPC-style swing and small timing/velocity humanising for the "played" styles. Styles with fills play one at the end of 4-bar phrases (always a longer one every 8 bars) and hit a crash on the next downbeat; trap adds hi-hat rolls. In Infinite mode the style is picked from those suited to the current tempo.

| Pattern | Grid | Character |
|---|---|---|
| MINIMAL | 16 | Kick 1 & 3, snare 2 & 4 |
| 4/4 | 16 | Rock: kick 1, 3, 3&; accented 8th hats; snare fills |
| HOUSE | 16 | Four on the floor, clap 2 & 4, off-beat open hats, shaker |
| FUNK | 16 | Syncopated kick, accented backbeat with ghost notes, 16th hats, open hat on the 4&, light swing |
| BOOM BAP | 16 | Hip-hop, 58% swing |
| BREAK | 16 | Staggered kick, asymmetric hats, slight swing |
| JUNGLE | 16 | Syncopated kick, ghost snares, busy hats |
| 2-STEP | 16 | UK garage: kick skips beat 3, swung hats and shaker |
| TRAP | 16 | Half-time snare + clap, 808 kick tuned to the key, 16th hats with rolls |
| HALF TIME | 16 | Snare + clap on 3 |
| SHUFFLE | 12 | Triplet blues shuffle (long-short hats) |
| SWING | 12 | Jazz ride ("ding, ding-a-ding"), hi-hat foot on 2 & 4, feathered kick, random comping ghost notes |
| BRUSHES | 16 | Brush sweeps each beat, brush taps on 2 & 4, triplet swing |
| BOSSA | 16 | Bossa kick (1, 2&, 3, 4&) and cross-stick clave |
| ONE DROP | 12 | Reggae: kick + cross-stick on 3 only, shuffled hats |
| DEMBOW | 16 | Reggaeton: four-on-the-floor kick, 3-3-2 snare |
| AFRO 12/8 | 12 | West African standard bell pattern, shaker, congas tuned to the key |
| CINEMATIC | 16 | Taiko hits, tom ostinato tuned to the key, tom fills |
| GHOST | 16 | Very sparse, atmospheric |

**Kit** (all synthesised): kick (sine sweep, soft saturation for small speakers, beater click) · 808 kick (long boom tuned to the key root) · snare (two shell modes + band-passed wires) · clap (three hands + room tail) · cross-stick · hi-hats (TR-808 "metal": six square waves at inharmonic frequencies, band-passed; closing the hat chokes a ringing open hat) · ride (noise wash + metal shimmer + stick ping) · crash · toms and congas (tuned to root and fifth) · taiko · shaker · cowbell · brush sweep and tap. Kick, snare and clap sit centre; the other pieces are spread across the stereo field.

Kick and snare levels scale with `density`; cymbals and shaker with `brightness`.

### Musical scales

Seven scales defined as semitone intervals from the root:

| Scale | Intervals | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Aeolian | 0 2 3 5 7 8 10 | Natural minor — dark, classical |
| Dorian | 0 2 3 5 7 9 10 | Minor with raised 6th — jazzy, open |
| Phrygian | 0 1 3 5 7 8 10 | Flat 2nd — tense, Iberian flavour |
| Minor pentatonic | 0 3 5 7 10 | 5 notes — sparse, bluesy |
| Major pentatonic | 0 2 4 7 9 | 5 notes — open, optimistic |
| Lydian | 0 2 4 6 7 9 11 | Raised 4th — floating, ethereal |
| Mixolydian | 0 2 4 5 7 9 10 | Flat 7th — bright but unresolved |

Pitches are standard MIDI note numbers (69 = A4 = 440 Hz): `hz = 440 × 2^((midi − 69) / 12)`. The tonic is kept within C3–B3; register comes from the octave setting, folded per instrument into its playable range.

### Plucked strings (Karplus–Strong)

Pluck, harp, sitar, clavinet and the plucked/walking bass use a physical string model: a noise burst — low-passed for a soft finger or left bright for a pick, and comb-filtered at the pluck position — circulates in a delay line one period long with an averaging filter in the loop, so upper partials die away faster than the fundamental, exactly as on a real string. A first-order allpass supplies the fractional part of the delay, keeping every note within ±1 cent of pitch from E1 to E6 (rounding to whole samples would be up to 26 cents off in the top octave). Decay time is set as T60 per note.

### Mix and effects

- **Reverb:** a stereo impulse of decaying noise whose spectrum darkens over the tail (real rooms absorb highs faster than lows), with 22 ms pre-delay and a 180 Hz high-pass on the send so the low end stays dry and clear.
- **Echo:** a tempo-synced ping-pong delay (dotted eighth) with band-limited repeats, used by the arpeggio, kalimba, bell, texture and melody. Its time follows tempo changes.
- **Master:** 30 Hz high-pass and a gentle compressor, as before.
- **Levels:** every voice was measured offline (ITU-R BS.1770 loudness) and balanced by role — beds ≈ −24 LUFS, bass ≈ −22 to −26, leads ≈ −27, motion ≈ −30, air ≈ −32, drum kits ≈ −25 (jazz kits ≈ −29) when soloed. Previously the spread was over 40 dB (the pluck was effectively silent).

## Evolution Engine (Infinite mode)

The music evolves at two timescales.

### Continuous drift

On every tick (~60 ms), three state parameters randomly walk:

- **`brightness`** (0.05–0.95) — filter cutoffs, cymbal level
- **`density`** (0.1–1.0) — melody and drum gain scaling
- **`spaciousness`** (0.1–0.9) — reverb send amount

Each drifts by ±0.001–0.002 per tick.

### Era transitions (every ~38 seconds)

An era change waits for the next **chord change**. Every voice schedules up to that exact beat in the old key, then the new era starts on it — so no note straddles the old and new key, and the tempo change lands on the beat.

1. **Root note** moves by a closely related interval from `[−7, −5, −2, 0, 0, 2, 5, 7]` semitones (doubled `0` makes staying in key twice as likely), wrapped to stay within one octave
2. **Scale** changes to a random mode
3. **Chord progression** (a new AABA form) is drawn for the new mode
4. **Tempo** drifts, bounded to 52–130 BPM; **octave**, **chord length** and the three feel parameters are re-rolled
5. A new arrangement is built from roles; bass and drum styles are re-rolled (drums from styles that suit the new tempo)
6. Every voice re-enters on the new era's first downbeat; a sounding drone fades out under the new one

## Visual Engine

Rendered with [Three.js r183](https://threejs.org/) via WebGL at native pixel ratio. Animation loop runs via `requestAnimationFrame`.

### Scene objects

The ring and the central sphere are driven by the **music itself** rather than the spectrum. Every voice logs each note (pitch, voice, velocity, length) and every drum hit as the scheduler commits it (`src/audio/notes.js`); `src/visuals/music.js` plays that log back in step with what is reaching the speakers — audio clock minus the output latency, so it stays in sync even over Bluetooth. (The old 64-bar spectrum ring put every note the engine plays into 5 bars and left 37 bars above 5 kHz dark most of the time.)

Pitch is laid out on the **circle of fifths** (C, G, D, A, E, B, F♯ …) around the scene. That puts a key's scale in one unbroken arc and a chord's tones next to each other, so harmony reads as a shape. Each pitch class has a colour: the tonic takes the palette hue and every fifth turns 30°.

**Harmonic halo** (`src/visuals/halo.js`) — a planetary ring of 16,000 dust particles around the sphere, animated entirely in a vertex shader:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Angle | Pitch class, on the circle of fifths |
| Ringlet | Octave — seven concentric bands (C1 innermost … C7 outermost) with gaps between them |
| Glow | The key's scale glows as a coloured arc that swings round when the key changes; chord tones brighter |
| Plume | A sounding note lights its patch of dust, which lifts off the plane into a sparkling plume following the note's envelope; the onset throws a brief burst outward |

The dust orbits with Keplerian shear (inner ringlets faster), so it streams through the lit regions, which stay fixed in space.

**Chord constellation** — a ring-shaped star on each tone of the current chord, joined by dotted lines of light with pulses travelling along them. On the circle of fifths a major and a minor triad are mirror-image triangles and a seventh chord is a quadrilateral, so the harmony is a visible shape; the corners glide to the next chord's tones on each change, and a corner flares when its note is actually sounding.

**Harmonic sphere** — five nested wireframe icosahedra (vertices merged, so each of 362 points per layer is computed once), each listening to part of the band: bass (inner), motion, lead and air (outer). The whole shape bulges toward the current chord's pitch classes — the same directions as the lit halo sectors and the constellation — and morphs when the chord changes. Each note onset sends a ripple across its layer from the note's direction on the halo (high notes start near the top); the kick punches the inner layers and the snare the outer ones; a faint shimmer from a log-spaced spectrum keeps the surface alive. Each layer is coloured by one chord tone. Self-rotates, faster with audio energy.

**Inner glow sphere** — `AdditiveBlending`, coloured by the chord root, swells with the bass line and the kick.

**Star field** — 7,500 small point stars and 80 large sprite stars, placed using 3D value noise rejection sampling for organic clustering. Each star stores cylindrical coordinates and is animated every frame by a three-component aperiodic flow field using irrational-ratio frequencies (φ, √2, √3) so the motion never visibly repeats.

Small stars use a `PointsMaterial` with `vertexColors: true` — every star has a unique colour baked at placement time. Stars are divided into four personality types:

| Type | Proportion | Hue behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Musical | ~38% | Follows the palette hue with a small personal offset |
| Blue-white (O/B type) | ~24% | Fixed cool hue (~198–234°) regardless of key |
| Warm orange/red (K/M type) | ~18% | Fixed warm hue (~14–40°) |
| Near-white neutral | ~20% | Low saturation, any hue |

Large stars are individual `Sprite` objects with two stacked layers: the original PNG for the soft diffuse halo, and a generated overlay providing the diffraction spikes and bright core. The overlay renders at 1.6× the halo scale (matching how diffraction spikes extend beyond the stellar disc in real telescope imagery). Both layers share the same per-star colour personality.

**Volumetric nebulae** — 22 large cloud sprites with elliptical aspect ratios and static rotations for organic variety. Each is a soft radial gradient (white-on-transparent, generated via canvas) rendered with `AdditiveBlending` at low opacity (0.14–0.32). Colour types are weighted toward fixed deep blues, purples, and magentas, with ~20% following the palette hue. Each nebula slowly orbits with an independent speed and direction, and floats vertically on an aperiodic sine cycle (period ~63–105 seconds). Overlapping clouds accumulate intensity, producing the volumetric impression without ray-marching.

**Animation fade-in** — when playback starts, `energy` and `bass` ramp from 0 to their real values over 2.5 seconds. The camera orbit radius and Y oscillation also lerp smoothly from their idle positions. This prevents an abrupt visual jump when the audio begins. Stars are animated and visible even before playback starts (at energy=0).

### Colour

A single hue drives the base palette: `hue = (pitchClass × 15 + 180 + era × 40) % 360`. Each root note has a characteristic colour; each era shifts it by 40°. Fixed-temperature star types (blue-white, warm) are anchored to their astrophysical colours and do not shift with the key.

### Camera

Orbits the origin at radius 7.5, angle incrementing by `0.0035 + energy×0.0018`. Y position oscillates as `sin(cameraAngle × 0.37) × 2.2 + 1.0`. The frequencies 1.0 and 0.37 are incommensurate so the path never exactly repeats.
